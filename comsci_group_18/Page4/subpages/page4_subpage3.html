      <strong><u>1990s - The Era of Foundation and Fire</u></strong>
      <p>
        The 90s cemented hip hop as a cultural powerhouse. Lyricism, storytelling, and raw authenticity took
        center stage as artists used the microphone to reflect their realities and challenge the status quo.
        From gritty boom-bap beats to smooth West Coast grooves, the decade delivered iconic voices and timeless
        albums that shaped the blueprint for everything that followed. Hip hop in the 90s wasn’t just music, it
        was a movement, bold, unapologetic, and impossible to ignore.

      <strong><u>2000s - The Age of Expansion and Innovation</u></strong>
      <p>
        As hip hop entered the 2000s, it grew bigger, louder, and more diverse. The genre crossed borders and broke
        into the mainstream with unprecedented force. Producers experimented with new sounds; crunk, chipmunk soul,
        glossy synths. While artists expanded hip hop’s identity across fashion, entertainment, and global culture.
        The 2000s proved that hip hop wasn’t limited to a single style or story; it was a worldwide phenomenon,
        evolving faster than ever before.
