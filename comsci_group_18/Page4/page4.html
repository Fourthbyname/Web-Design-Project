    <h2 class="Darragh">What is hip hop all about?</h2>
    <p class="Darragh">
      Hip hop is the heartbeat of the streets. Raw energy, bold expression, and unstoppable rhythm. 
	  Born from block parties and booming bass, it blends slick beats, sharp lyrics, and fearless
	  creativity into a culture that moves the world. It’s more than music, it’s style, story, swagger,
	  and soul. If you want sound that speaks truth and makes you move, hip hop is where the fire lives.

    <h2 class="Darragh">Characteristics</h2>
    <p class="Darragh">
        Hip hop is defined by its rhythmic vocal style—rap—delivered over beats built from drum machines, sampling,
	    and looping. It often emphasizes strong, syncopated rhythms and a groove driven by bass and percussion.
		Lyrically, hip hop ranges from storytelling and social commentary to wordplay and braggadocio, reflecting
		the culture and experiences of its creators. The genre also embodies a broader cultural movement that includes
		DJing, breakdancing, and graffiti, all rooted in creativity, self-expression, and community.
