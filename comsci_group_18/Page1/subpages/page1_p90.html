                    <p class="fave">
                        The roots of Afrobeats can be traced back to the 1960s and 1970s with pioneering artists like Fela Kuti, who is often credited as the father of the genre. 
                        Fela Kuti fused traditional African rhythms with jazz, funk, and highlife to create a unique sound that laid the foundation for modern Afrobeats. 
                        During this period, the music was characterized by its complex rhythms, socially conscious lyrics, and extended instrumental solos. 
                        Other notable artists from this era include Tony Allen, Fela's drummer, who played a crucial role in shaping the Afrobeats sound, and King Sunny Ade, who popularized juju music, a style closely related to Afrobeats.
                        The pre-1990s era of Afrobeats was marked by its political activism and cultural expression, with many songs addressing issues such as corruption, inequality, and colonialism. 
                        This period set the stage for the global rise of Afrobeats in the following decades.
