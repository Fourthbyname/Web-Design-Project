          The American thrash-metal band Megadeth is loved by many due to it's rhythmically complex progressive edge, 
          long guitar solos and frequent tempo changes. The band was formed in 1983 in Los Angeles when Dave Mustaine 
          was kicked from the band Metallica (remember that name!) and formed another group out of revenge, striving for
          a faster and heavier band. They are considered one of the most influential music groups of the 80s, inspiring 
          other metal bands such as Slipknot and Pantera. However, their 1990s album "Rust In Peace" is considered their 
          best work, many dubbing it as "The greatest album ever made". Give it a listen down below!

            Formed in Huntington Park, California in 1981, Slayer has been hailed as one of the "Big Four" for decades, 
            along side the previous entry, "Megadeth", another amazing band, "Anthrax", and the number 1 spot on this 
            list! The thrash metal group steals the stage with their intense performances that were cultivated by their 
            downtuned rhythms, infectious guitar licks, graphically violent lyrics and grisly artwork. While some consider 
            them fallen from their former glory, people stillworship their earlier work, stating it as the foundation for 
            thrash bands and upcomingsub-genres like death metal. We feel that their greatest album, "Reign In Blood", is a 
            perfect example of their power, lend your ear to it for a song or two.

          Iron Maiden were pioneers of the new wave of the British heavy metal movement of the 80s. They've released many albums which
          gone gold and platinum in the US and UK (the best of which you can listen to below!). Their popularity is all in thanks to the 
          bands fluidity and uinqueness. The songs are written based of melodies rather than riffs, giving each song character. Combining
          this with constantly changing members in their early days, as well sa their mascot "Eddie the Head" that appears on their covers,
          every Iron Maiden album feels like an entry into the metal hall of fame. Despite originating from 1975, this East London band still
          manages to capture the thrill of metal with each chord struck.

          Black Sabbath, the oldest band on this list, were formed in 1968 in Birmingham, first going by Polka Tunk Blues Band, then
          Earth and finally settling on Black Sabbath in 1969. The horror inspired lyrics and down-tuned guitars really sold the occult
          theme the band was going for, causing their image to skyrocket and they quickly became one of the most influential heavy
          metal bands of all time, with The Rolling Stone dubbing them as "The Beatles of heavy metal". Their album "Paranoid" is
          considered by many to be the pinnacle of Black Sabbath and metal as a whole, and we believe it's definitely worth your 
          time the whole album a listen.

          I'm sure this 1981 group needs no introduction. The Los Angeles band Metallica is considered to be the face of the genre, thanks
          to expanding the genre's limits through the use of speed and volume to enhance their intricately structured propositions.
          From then until now, Metallica has stayed relevant in the modern day, with bands such as Korn and Testament considering them
          one of the greatest bands ever. Many credit this to the bands ballads that existed where others didn't or didn't try hard 
          enough. The evolution of the vocals led the songs to be more digestible to the mainstream and easily hummable. Couple this with
          captivating riffs and thrilling live shows, and you've got the recipe for a masterpiece of music. We recommend giving "Master of
          Puppets" a listen down below, with many artists and listeners alike claiming it as their favourite album thanks to it's dynamic
          music and thick arrangments.
