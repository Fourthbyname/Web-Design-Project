          The genre of metal originated from the genre of rock, which itself originated from the genre of blues, so let's start there.
          The grungey guitar riffs of metal harkens all the way back to the early 1950s, where Memphis Blue guitarists such as Joe Hill
          Louis, Willie Johnson and Pat Hare would would capture a "grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound". This would
          be the starting point for metal's distortion-heavy riffs and power chords. Other inspirations came from late 1960s surf rock
          like Dick Dale's "Let's Go Trippin'", as well as the late 1950s instrumentals of Link Wray such as "Rumble" and many, many more.
          <br><br>
          This start wouldn't be so obvious until the mid-1960s however, where American blues music was the main inspiration for the early
          British rockers of that era. Bands such as The Rolling Stones would record covers of blues songs and sped up the tempo, creating
          the genre of blues rock. As they experimented, these UK bands and US inspired groups would begin to popularise that loud distorted
          guitar sound we all know and love.

          The evolution into what would eventually become heavy metal would slowly come into fruition with the combination of psychedelic
          rock and acid rock which would be combined with the loud and heavy blues rock. Many characteristics started here, with acid rock
          containing a loud, improvised and heavily distorted guitar-centered sound. The major player in this movement was the British power
          trio "Cream", who made massive, heavy sounds by unison riffing between the guitarist and bassist, backed by double-bass drumming.
          Their first two LP's, "Fresh Cream" and "Disraeli Gears", are considered essential prototypes of future heavy metal. Other sparks
          of inspiration came from people like Jimi Hendrix and bands such as Vanilla Fudge, who would create "loud, heavy, slowed-down 
          arrangements" of popular songs at the time, blowing them up to "epic proportions" and "bathing them in a trippy, distorted haze".
          <br><br>
          The image of metal, such as devilish and occult imagery, originated with many psychedelic singers in the late 1960s like Arthur
          Brown, whose performances would be described as theatrical, outlandish and macabre. This image was pushed further by the 
          American psychedelic rock band Coven, who saw themselves as practitioners of witchcraft and black magic, using Satanic imagery
          in their lyrics, performances and album art. Their 1969 release, "Witchcraft Destroys The Mind & Reaps Souls", featured skulls,
          black masses and devil worship, and was the start of that iconic metal hand gesture: the horns.

          Either Black Sabbath or Led Zepplin are considered to be the first heavy metal band, with the third band Deep Purple creating
          the "unholy trinity" of heavy metal along with the other two. Arguments are also made for groups like Steppenwolf, Iron
          Butterfly and Vanilla Fudge to be the first band to play heavy metal. In 1968, the sound began to coalesce, with bands like 
          Blue Cheer and the Jeff Beck Group releasing songs and albums considered to be the first of their kind. This kept on escalating
          with many more bands taking on this style, like Led Zepplin, Grand Funk Railroad, Blue Öyster Cult, AC/DC and Dio, the last of 
          which escalated the fantastical lyrics found in the genre at that time. 
          <br><br>
          This creation was put to a halt with the emergence of punk rock in the mid-1970s, which was seen as a retortion to overproduced
          rock music at the time, which included heavy metal. As such, metal sales declined in favour of disco, punk and mainstream rock,
          but the fire was kept alive by underground artists who would put out cheaply recorded releases to devoted fans. Motörhead was
          the first important band to bring the spotlight back onto metal with a slight hint of punk. Bands like Iron Maiden, Saxon and 
          Def Leppard would roll with this and revitalise the heavy metal genre brought back by Motörhead and Judas Priest, toughening
          up the sound, reducing its blues elements and emphasizing increasingly fast tempos.
