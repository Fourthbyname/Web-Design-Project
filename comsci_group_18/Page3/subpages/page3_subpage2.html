          The popularity of metal exploded before the turn of the century thanks to popular bands like Bon Jovi and Guns N' Roses, causing
          many bands to either shift or begin playing heavy metal music. In turn, this created many subgenres that appealed to many people.
          These include genres like death metal, black metal, power metal and doom metal. These early subgenres were heavily influenced
          by thrash metal, a sub genre created under the influence of hardcore punk and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. This was
          pioneered by the "Big Four of Thrash": Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer.
          <br><br>
          The genre as a whole began gaining more and more traction the more people innovated on it. Death metal bands would up the speed
          and aggression of thrash metal, combining it with Satanic lyrics and vocals comprised of "gutteral death growls" and high-pitched 
          screaming. Black metal came from Europe, emphasizing shrieked and growled vocals, highly distorted guitars frequently played with
          rapid tremolo picking, a dark atmosphere and intentionally lo-fi production, often with ambient noise and background hiss. Power
          metal was created in opposition to these two, utilising clean lyrics and melodic approach of bands like Iron Maiden and Judas 
          Priest played with thrash's speed and energy. Finally, doom metal went in a completely different direction and slowed the music
          to a crawl, focusing on melody, melancholy tempos and a sepulchral mood.

          Old school bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden kept the genre alive and new bands would constantly join the genre to put
          their spin on the music. Metal was an ever-expanding genre, taking inspiration from other genres like pop and hip-hop, as well 
          as influencing other artists to put a metal spin on their music. This sparked a constant change in metal throughout the 1990s
          the umbrella term alternative metal, a movement led by bands like Alice In Chains. Bands that fused styles include Faith No 
          More which combined metal, rock and hip-hop, Tool utilised elements of progressive rock and metal and bands like Nine Inch
          Nails began incorporating metal into their unique industrial sound.
          <br><br>
          In the mid to late 1990s, this movement spawned a new wave of U.S metal groups inspired by alternative metal music and their 
          mixing of genres. This was dubbed nu-metal, and included bands like Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Linkin Park and Korn, which took 
          elements from death metal to hip-hop, often including DJ and rap-style vocals. Nu-metal exploded in popularity thanks to 
          the TV channel MTV and Ozzy Osbourne's introduction of OzzFest, leading the media to talk of a resurgence of heavy metal.
          However, traditional metal fans didn't embrace this style and by 2003, the popularity of nu-metal began to wane although
          several bands like Limp Bizkit and Korn kept the smaller fan base fueled.

          In recent times, more modern subgenres have emerged, most prominently metalcore, a hybrid of extreme metal and hardcore
          punk, which was only an underground sensation until the mid-2000s. This caused heavy metal to remain popular in the 2000s,
          particularly in places like Scandanavia which produced innovative and successful bands, the market for which existed in Belgium,
          the Netherlands and Germany. Metal music is more favorably embraced in Scandinavia and Northern Europe than other regions due 
          to social and political openness in these regions;[284] Finland in particular has been often called the "Promised Land of Heavy 
          Metal", as there are more than 50 metal bands for every 100,000 inhabitants
          <br><br>
          More genres kept cropping up constantly. Deathcore combines elements of death metal, hardcore punk and metalcore with unique death
          growling and "pig-squeal"-sounding vocals. By the early 2010s, metalcore was evolving more and more, and more frequently incorporated
          synthesizers and elements from other genres outside of rock and metal. Bands such as the Devil Wears Prada and Bring Me The Horizon
          utilised these changes and saw critical acclaim from accross the globe. As such, bands like these have led to inspire more and more
          upcoming bands to innovate on the genre, causing metal to be one of the most constantly changing genres in music today.
