          This Liverpool nu-metalcore band is a favourite of mine, and has gained a good amount of popularity since it's inception in 2014.
          It's a clash of the heaviest metal and melodic moments of respite to create a style of music uniquely chaotic and calming. This
          is done by switching from clean to unclean vocals on a whim, backed by melodies constructed electronically and addicting guitar
          riffs. I believe their album "I Let It In And It Took Everything" is their best work yet, even though they have only released 
          3 albums, with their 4th right around the corner. Even if this isn't your thing, give "Is It Really You" a listen, it's a song 
          that really gives the group it's identity and might pull you into the genre like it did for me.

          Sleep Token lives on the edge of genres. Each song produced by the anonymous London group ranges from a splash of pop to wading
          through metal. As such, it's probably quite the risk putting this band here, but I believe they have enough songs and identity to
          make the cut. Their image is that of a religious group, worshipping an ancient deity called "Sleep". As such, their members are 
          named, "I", "II" and "III", with the lead vocalist being called "Vessel". They even call their concerts "rituals". Their songs
          reflect this, with angelic vocals and electronic tunes to pull on your heart strings. This is even incorporated in heavier 
          songs, with brief respites before plunging back into the quintissential guitar and drums of metal. Cultic imagery aside, I
          believe they're worth a listen and what better place to start than "Take Me Back To Eden". Trust me, you'll like something here.

          Time for a more popular entry. Bring Me The Horizon was formed in Sheffield, 2004 and since then have gained popularity through
          their chameleonic genre hopping and collaberations with many other artists. The band is considered to be metalcore, but has 
          taken influence from pop bands such as "Twenty One Pilots" and made music with rap artists like "Lil Uzi Vert". This is all in 
          an attempt to stand out, with the band's main goal to make every album different from the last. Again, this is probably teetering 
          the edge of what I should be allowed to recommend, but their early work justifies my choice. It harkens back to deathcore, a subgenre
          with loud vocals and even louder guitar. That probably put you off this group altogether but even still, I think you should give
          "Sempiternal" a few minutes of your time.

          The last band I have for you is Bad Omens, an American heavy metal band formed in 2014 in Richmond, Virginia. This 5 man group
          steals the stage with the heavenly voice of their lead singer and melodic guitar solos to help them deliver music that gives you
          goosebumps. The lyrics mainly focus on addiction, love and mental health struggles, leading to a sense of relatability that a lot
          of fans find in their music. While their songs are mostly metalcore and alternative metal, some of their newer work is leaning more
          towards the R&B and electronic genres. If that's what your into, maybe look into it, but I'm going to recommend to you "THE DEATH OF
          PEACE OF MIND" and plead that you listen to the bands biggest hit to date "Just Pretend". (The vocals are very, very good.)
