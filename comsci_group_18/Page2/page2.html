    <h2 class="Ben">About</h2>
    <p class="Ben">
      Rock and Roll (Often shortened to Rock) has, since its mainstream breakthrough in the 1950's, consistently been one of the most popular genres of 
      popular music. A unique fusion of genres such as blues, jazz, and country just to name a few, the rebellious spirit of rock and roll music has captured 
      the minds of generations of people. From the sneering vocals of Mick Jagger, to the crashing drum fills of John Bonham, to the iconic slap of a Flea bass
      line, to David Gilmour's roaring guitar solos, this is a genre that has truly has something to offer for everyone.</p>
    
    <h2 class="Ben">Characteristics</h2>
    <p class="Ben">
      The iconic rock and roll sound is a product of the core characteristics of the music within the genre. The electric guitar, which when combined with 
      high-gain amplifiers and effects such as distortion, is a critical part of the rock and roll sound. Electric guitars would become the defining instrument of 
      rock, often used as both a lead instrument, giving us those roaring guitar solos we associate with many rock hits, or as a rhythmic instrument, 
      providing backing to a singer or a lead guitarist. Vocals are typically harsh, but full of emotion and expression. Many rock classics are defined by the 
      high-pitched wails of singers such as Robert Plant or Axl Rose. Lyrically, rock vocalists often sing about themes associated with rebellion, love and the
      struggles of the working class population. To tie this all together a strong rhythmic backbone is key. The aforementioned electric 
      guitar is often a part of this, along with bass and drums. Upright bass was used in rock's earliest days to provide a strong low-end. The bass guitar, 
      similar to a traditional stringed bass but much smaller in size and intended to be played horizontally, would soon replace upright bass as the go-to 
      instrument in providing bass. Combined with the electrification seen on the traditional guitar, bass could take advantage of many of the benefits of the 
      electric guitar too. Finally, there's the drums, responsible for providing a strong, driving backbeat.
