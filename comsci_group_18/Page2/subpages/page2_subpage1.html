    <h1 class="Ben">Rock and Roll: Pre 1990s History</h1>
  <h2 class="Ben">1950s</h2>
    <p class="Ben">
      The 1950s is generally cited as the decade where rock and roll became mainstream. Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freedman is credited with popularising the term 'Rock and Roll' itself, when he began using
      it to describe the R&B music he was playing on his radio show in 1951. Indeed, much of this early rock music was heavily inspired by R&B. Also in 1951, Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm would release
      'Rocket 88', which many claim to be the first true rock and roll record due to its distorted guitar sound, said to have been generated by a damaged amplifier. A few years later in 1954, 
      Bill Haley & His Comets would release 'Rock Around The Clock', which became the first true rock and roll hit in 1955 following its inclusion in the film 'Blackboard Jumgle'.
	<br>
  The mid-to-late 1950's has been termed as the 'golden age' of rock and roll music, as it became a global phenomenom. In 1955, Chuck Berry, nicknamed the 'Father of Rock and Roll', would release
  'Maybellene', which would peak at number 5 on Billboard's Pop chart. As his nickname would suggest, Berry was a hugely influential figure in the rock and roll movement. His signature guitar sound,
  stage presence and lyricism essentially became the blueprint for what rock and roll music was all about. He is most well known for his 1958 hit 'Johnny B. Goode', featuring an intro riff and chorus that
  is recognisable even to those who are not fans of the genre. 
	<br>
	While Berry is credited as being the 'Father of Rock and Roll', Little Richard, who broke out into the mainstream at a similar time to Berry, earned the title of the 'Architect of Rock and Roll'. He 
	pioneered the raw, shout-like vocals that rock would become famous for into the mainstream, which combined with his energetic piano playing and visual flair created a strong stage presence. Richard also 
	achieved his first hit in 1955, when he released 'Tutti Frutti', featuring outrageous lyrics for the time. Ultimately, this lyrical style would become a key part of the rock sound. 
	<br>		
	Elvis Presley, or 'The King of Rock and Roll', is likely the most famous and instantly recognisable of the early rock stars. He became a household name in 1956 with his single 'Heartbreak Hotel', 
	bringing his rockabilly sound to the masses. This sound was created by a unique fusion of R&B vocals with country-style instrumentation. Critical to Elvis' success, and later the success of the genre as a 
	whole, was that he was one of the first white artists to prove the commercial viability of 'black' musical styles such as R&B, helping to break down the racial divides within society. Similarly to Little 
	Richard, Elvis' success was just as much about how he looked and behaved on stage as it was about the music itself. His on-stage antics were considered outrageous by the conservative adult population, but 
	were embraced by the younger generations, showing us how rock was just as much about energetic performances as it was about musical excellence. He became much more than just a rock star, as he would launch
	a career in film and television, making him a global celebrity. Unfortunately, he was drafted into the army for two years starting in 1958, halting his seemingly unstoppable momentum.
	<br>
	While other early rock stars, particularly Elvis, would personify the bad-boy image of early rock stars, Buddy Holly would adopt a much tamer stage presence.
  Nonetheless, the image of a glasses and suit wearing teenager wielding a Fender Stratocaster would become just as iconic. Holly's influence on the genre would come more from his role in changing how rock
  music was made. Together with his band, The Crickets, Holly would pioneer the traditional four-piece rock band, consisting of lead & rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums, a concise approach compared to
  the orchestral backing of many of his contemporaries. Further simplifying the music making process, Holly and The Crickets would write and perform their own music, rather than outsourcing this to 
	professional songwriters and musicians. Holly broke into the mainstream in 1957 with 'That'll be the day' and 'Peggy Sue', before his life was tragically cut short in a plane crash in 1959.

	<h2 class="Ben">1960s</h2>
	<p class="Ben">
		At the beginning of the 1960s it looked like the Rock and Roll movement was already dying, following the death of Buddy Holly, Elvis being drafted into the army and many of the early pioneers
		pursuing alternative musical direction. However, a generation of youths from Britain were about to take the genre to new heights, in what was termed the 'British Invasion'. The most successful of these
		groups were The Beatles. The Liverpool based quartet consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, who were collectively dubbed 'The Fab Four'. They adopted a clean
		appearance consisting of their famous 'mob top' haircuts and black suits, similar to what Buddy Holly and The Crickets had done. This wasn't the only influence they took from The Crickets, as they
		would adopt a similar four-piece structure (In the earliest days, Lennon on Rhythm Guitar and Lead Vocals, McCartney on Bass and sharing lead vocals with Lennon, Harrison on lead guitar and backing
		vocals, Starr on drums) and internal songwriting process (Most of the early songs being attributed to the Lennon-McCartney partnership). With other influences from other early rock stars, they
		released 'Please Please Me' in March 1963. While big in the United Kingdom, it wouldn't be until early 1964 that they would become huge in America. The single 'I Want to Hold Your Hand', would
		release in  the US in December 1963 (November 1963 in the UK), entering the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 45 on 18 January 1964, before topping the charts on February 1st. This, coupled with a famous
		performance on the Ed Sullivan Show which was viewed by 73 million people (the most watched event on American TV up until that point) signalled their arrival as the biggest band in the world.
