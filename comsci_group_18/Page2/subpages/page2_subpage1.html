    <h1 class="Ben">Rock and Roll: Pre 1990s History</h1>
  <h2 class="Ben">1950s</h2>
    <p class="Ben">
      The 1950s is generally cited as the decade where rock and roll became mainstream. Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freedman is credited with popularising the term 'Rock and Roll' itself, when he began using
      it to describe the R&B music he was playing on his radio show in 1951. Indeed, much of this early rock music was heavily inspired by R&B. Also in 1951, Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm would release
      'Rocket 88', which many claim to be the first true rock and roll record due to its distorted guitar sound, said to have been generated by a damaged amplifier. A few years later in 1954, 
      Bill Haley & His Comets would release 'Rock Around The Clock', which became the first true rock and roll hit in 1955 following its inclusion in the film 'Blackboard Jumgle'.
	<br>
		From this point onwards rock and roll would begin to solidify itself as a global phenomenon. The mid-to-late 1950s would see many of rock's early pioneers break into the mainstream. Chuck Berry, nicknamed
		'The Father of Rock and Roll', would wow audiences with his signature R&B influenced guitar sound on hits like 'Maybellene' (1955) and 'Johnny B. Goode' (1958), as well as his unique stage
		presence. Artists such as Little Richard and Elvis Presley would take this stage presence to an entirely new level, with their flamboyant performances influencing most rock acts that would follow. 
		Richard was known for his raw, shout-like vocals that would be adopted by many of the rock singers that would follow. Elvis meanwhile is credited with turning rock and roll into an international
		movement. He became much more than just a rock star, as he would launch a successful career in television and film. Buddy Holly and The Crickets would have their first hit in 1957 with 'That'll
		Be The Day'. The band are credited with pioneering the traditional four-piece rock band structure (lead & rhythm guitarists, bassist and drummer), as well as being one of the first acts to write
		and perform their own music. Indeed, many of the rock acts that came before them had been either covering or reinterpreting previously written material.

	<h2 class="Ben">1960s</h2>
	<p class="Ben">
		At the beginning of the 1960s it looked like the Rock and Roll movement was already dying, following the death of Buddy Holly, Elvis being drafted into the army and many of the early pioneers
		pursuing alternative musical direction. However, a generation of youths from Britain were about to take the genre to new heights, in what was termed the 'British Invasion'. 
		<br>
		The most famous and influential of these British groups were The Beatles, consisting of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. Despite having a short career in the mainstream, 
		spanning from 1963 to 1970, their impact on global culture cannot be overstated. Known in the early days for their catchy melodies and relatable lyrics, they would later produce more abstract albums 
		such as 'Revolver' (1966), 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' (1967) and 'Abbey Road' (1969). These albums are generally considered as their 3 best works, and indeed some of the best albums of 
		all time. The Rolling Stones would also emerge at roughly the same time as The Beatles. The Stones offered a grittier form of rock music heavily influenced from traditional blues artists. Hits such as
		1965's '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction' would go on to define the bands sound, with the song featuring lyrics exploring themes of sexual frustration, as well as one of the most instantly recognisable
		guitar riffs of all time. While The Beatles had disbanded by 1970, the Stones would continue into the 1970s, beginning their own exceptional 3 album run with 1969's 'Let It Bleed', featuring the hit
		single 'Gimme Shelter'.
		<br>
		The heavier, blues influenced riffs of The Rolling Stones would become the blueprint of the hard rock scene that developed in the latter part of the 1960s. The popularity of the heavy blues rock sound in
		Britain prompted guitarist Jimi Hendrix to move to England, where he and his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, would launch a successful career, starting with 1967's 'Are You Experienced?'. Hendrix is often
		listed as number 1 on lists ranking the greatest guitarists of all time. Led Zeppelin would release their self titled debut album and its follow up 'Led Zeppelin II' in 1969. Zeppelin would go on
		to become one of the greatest bands in the genres history, with their members often listed as some of the greatest of all time in their fields. Singles like 'Whole Lotta Love' are a perfect example
		of the band's sound, featuring an iconic guitar riff and solo, screeching vocals, a thumping bass line and crashing drums.
<br>
		Rock would become the soundtrack to the protest era of the late 1960s. The Beatles would become synonymous with the hippie movement, with singles such as 'All You Need Is Love' being huge in the
		summer of 1967, otherwise known as 'The Summer of Love'. Other songs such as 'Fortunate Son' by Creedence Clearwater Revival would have a much more rebellious tone. This would culminate in the
		Woodstock festival in August 1969, bringing together over 400,000 people in a celebration of 'peace and music'.

	<h2 class="Ben">1970s</h2>
	<p class="Ben">
		My personal favourite decade for the rock genre, the 70s was all about excess. Whereas at the beginning of the 1960s most songs were within the 2 to 3 minute range, many rock classics from the 70s
		would be in excess of 5 minutes long. The early part of the decade was mostly dominated by bands who broke out in the 60s. The Beatles released 'Let It Be', their final album, in 1970. The Rolling Stones
		followed up 'Let It Bleed' with 'Sticky Fingers' in 1971 and then 'Exile On Main St.' in 1972, completing one of the greatest album runs of all time.  'Exile on Main St.' in particular is often lauded
		by critics as being the band's finest work. It was at this time that they cemented their reputation as the bad boys of rock and roll, as their antics both on and off the stage would be widely 
		publicised in the media. Led Zeppelin released 'Led Zeppelin III' in 1970, but it was their untitled fourth album (commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV) that would immortalise the group in music
		history, with the eight-minute progressive rock song 'Stairway to Heaven' a particular highlight.
<br>
		Progressive rock would ultimately dominate the early part of the 1970s, as bands combined compositional techniques from other genres with traditional rock. Pink Floyd would release 'The Dark Side Of
		The Moon' in 1973, which went on to become one of the decades genre-defining albums. A standout feature of the album is how it is mixed so that there is no gaps in between the songs, meaning
		listeners consume it as a singular piece of music rather than individual songs. It would go on to sell over 45 million copies worldwide, and is credited as being one of rocks true masterpieces. While
		Dark Side is often the defining album of progressive rock, Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (1975) is likely to be its defining song. A five part song spanning nearly six minutes, it takes listeners on a 
		journey that few other songs can compete with. Despite initial skepticism from critics it would be a massive hit worldwide, credited as being one of the greatest songs in the history of music.

		People would eventually become disillusioned with the increasing excess of rock music (For example, Pink Floyd would release a nine-part suite, 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond', in 1975, which would total
		26 minutes in length). This gave rise to the punk rock scene, as bands such as the Sex Pistols looked to strip rock and roll back to its purest form. Vocals were unrefined, and there was little
		complexity from an instrumental perspective. The Sex Pistols' 'Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols' (1977) and 'London Calling' (1979) from The Clash went on to become the defining albums 
		from the movement. It was generally short lived however, as the scene had largely fizzled out by the conclusion of the decade.
