  <h2 class="Ben">1950s</h2>
    <p class="Ben">
      The 1950s is generally cited as the decade where rock and roll became mainstream. Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freedman is credited with popularising the term 'Rock and Roll' itself, when he began using
      it to describe the R&B music he was playing on his radio show in 1951. Indeed, much of this early rock music was heavily inspired by R&B. Also in 1951, Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm would release
      'Rocket 88', which many claim to be the first true rock and roll record due to its distorted guitar sound, said to have been generated by a damaged amplifier. A few years later in 1954, 
      Bill Haley & His Comets would release 'Rock Around The Clock', which became the first true rock and roll hit in 1955 following its inclusion in the film 'Blackboard Jumgle'.

  The mid-to-late 1950's has been termed as the 'golden age' of rock and roll music, as it became a global phenomenom. In 1955, Chuck Berry, nicknamed the 'Father of Rock and Roll', would release
  'Maybellene', which would peak at number 5 on Billboard's Pop chart. As his nickname would suggest, Berry was a hugely influential figure in the rock and roll movement. His signature guitar sound,
  stage presence and lyricism essentially became the blueprint for what rock and roll music was all about. He is most well known for his 1958 hit 'Johnny B. Goode', featuring an intro riff and chorus that
  is recognisable even to those who are not fans of the genre. While Berry is credited as being the 'Father of Rock and Roll', Little Richard, who broke out into the mainstream at a similar time to Berry,
  earned the title of the 'Architect of Rock and Roll'. He pioneered the raw, shout-like vocals that rock would become famous for into the mainstream, which combined with his energetic piano playing and
  visual flair created a strong stage presence. Richard also achieved his first hit in 1955, when he released 'Tutti Frutti', featuring outrageous lyrics for the time. Ultimately, this lyrical style
  would become a key part of the rock sound. While other early rock stars, particularly Elvis, would personify the bad-boy image of early rock stars, Buddy Holly would adopt a much tamer stage presence.
  Nonetheless, the image of a glasses and suit wearing teenager wielding a Fender Stratocaster would become just as iconic. Holly's influence on the genre would come more from his role in changing how rock
  music was made. Together with his band, The Crickets, Holly would pioneer the traditional four-piece rock band, consisting of lead & rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums, a concise approach compared to
  the orchestral backing of many of his contemporaries. Further simplifying the music making process, Holly and The Crickets would write and perform their own music, rather than outsourcing this to professional
	songwriters and musicians. Holly broke into the mainstream in 1957 with 'That'll be the day' and 'Peggy Sue', before his life was tragically cut short in a plane crash in 1959
