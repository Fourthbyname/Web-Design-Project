      The rock genre continued to diversify into the 1990s, with many different groups bringing their own, unique sound to the genre. Grunge was the first major movement of the 1990s. Initially an underground
      movement largely developed in the north-western United States, Nirvana's 1991 album 'Nevermind', fuelled by the success of lead single 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', would propel the genre to the forefront
      of global culture. A bit of a slow burner, 'Nevermind' released in September 1991, but it did not top the US Billboard 200 until February 1992, when it dethroned Michael Jackson's 'Dangerous'. In the
      space of just four months grunge went from an underground movement to dethroning the 'King of Pop'. Nirvana's success would ultimately become Grunge's success, bringing other groups into the
      mainstream with them. Pearl Jam had released 'Ten' a month prior to 'Nevermind', but it would not reach its commercial peak (2nd on the Billboard 200) until the later half of 1992. Alice in Chains,
      whose 1990 debut 'Facelift' had peaked at number 42 on the Billboard 200, peaked as high as number 6 with their 1992 follow up 'Dirt'. Many grunge artists were unhappy with the popularity of the genre,
      in particular Nirvana's lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain. Nirvana had tried to distance themselves from the mainstream when they followed up 'Nevermind' with 'In Utero' in 1993, aiming for a much
      more underground and raw sound. Nonetheless, it recieved widespread commercial and critical acclaim, debuting at number 1 on the Billboard 200 with 180,000 copies sold in its first week on sale.
      The last major hit for grunge came in March 1994 when Soundgarden's 'Superunknown' sold a massive 310,000 copies in its first week on sale in the USA, taking the number 1 spot on the Billboard 200.
      The tragic suicide of Kurt Cobain a month later is often cited as the end of grunge's peak. With its poster boy gone, the genre gradually faded back into the shadows.

      Alternative rock would also prove hugely popular in the 1990s. Red Hot Chili Peppers became a mainstream success with 1991's 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik'. Most of the bands early material, and indeed
      most of this album, was heavily influenced by funk rock. But, 1992's 'Under The Bridge', a complete departure from their traditional sound, single handedly turned them into a commercial success,
      when it reached number 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, compared to the number 73 of previous single 'Give It Away'. Internal conflicts within the band and the departure of guitarist John Frusicante 
      meant the band would not release a follow up album until the underwhelming 'One Hot Minute' released in 1995. The band would largely return to form with 1999's 'Californication', whose much softer
      and melodic sound translated into the band's most commercially successful release to date.
