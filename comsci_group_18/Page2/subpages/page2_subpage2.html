	<h2 class="Ben">1990s</h2>
    <p class="Ben">
      The rock genre continued to diversify into the 1990s, with many different groups bringing their own, unique sound to the genre. Grunge was the first major movement of the 1990s. Initially an underground
      movement largely developed in the north-western United States, Nirvana's album 'Nevermind', fuelled by the success of lead single 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', would propel the genre to the forefront
      of global culture. A bit of a slow burner, 'Nevermind' released in September 1991, but it did not top the US Billboard 200 until February 1992, when it dethroned Michael Jackson's 'Dangerous'. 
			Nirvana's success would ultimately become Grunge's success, bringing other groups into the mainstream with them, such as Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. Many grunge artists were unhappy 
			with the popularity of the genre, in particular Nirvana's lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain. 'In Utero', the follow up to 'Nevermind', had a more unconventional sound, but nonetheless debuted on
			the Billboard 200 at number 1. Cobain's tragic death by suicide in April 1994 is often cited as the end of grunge in the mainstream.

      While grunge bands ruled the early part of the 1990s, other bands would also have their break into the mainstream in the early part of the decade. Red Hot Chili Peppers would have major success with 
			their album 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' (1991), before releasing their best-selling album 'Californication' in 1999. The band had largely been ignored during the 1980s due to their unrefined, raw sound, but
			their new direction would have much greater appeal to the masses. Radiohead released 'Pablo Honey' in 1993, featuring the band's biggest single 'Creep'. They would go on to become one of the most
			critically acclaimed bands of all time, mostly due to their musical experimentation. 1997's 'OK Computer' is often cited as their magnum opus. Pop punk band Green Day would have their commercial
			breakthrough with 1994's 'Dookie', offering a more mainstream take on the punk rock of the 1970s.

			Over in Britain the 'Britpop' movement would take hold during the mid 1990s. Largely a reaction to the darker themes of grunge, early bands such as Blur and Suede would write more upbeat music with an
			emphasis on British identity and culture. 1994 would see Blur release 'Parklife', becoming one of the defining albums of the movement. Also in 1994 Oasis released their debut album 'Definitely Maybe',
			which became the fastest selling debut album in UK history, an accolade it held until 2006. These two bands would become the defining groups of the Britpop movement (Despite sharing little similarities
			sonically), culminating in the 1995 chart war between Blur's 'Country House' and Oasis' 'Roll With It', in which 'Country House' would claim the number 1 spot on the British singles chart, with 'Roll
			With It' occupying second. Oasis however would surpass Blur and take the movement worldwide following the release of '(What's the Story) Morning Glory?' in October, featuring their biggest single, and
			indeed one of the biggest songs ever, 'Wonderwall'. The movement fizzled out by the end of the 1990s, as Blur moved into alternative rock with their self titled album in 1997, and Oasis' 'Be Here Now'
			(1997) not having the impact of its predecessor.

		The 2000s would see a range of bands from the 1990s continue their popularity. Green Day's 2004 album 'American Idiot' would be much more political than their previous material, became their second best
		selling album, only beaten by 'Dookie' from 1994.
