    <h1 class="Ben">Rock and Roll: 1990s - Present</h1>
	<h2 class="Ben">1990s</h2>
    <p class="Ben">
      The rock genre continued to diversify into the 1990s, with many different groups bringing their own, unique sound to the genre. Grunge was the first major movement of the 1990s. Initially an underground
      movement largely developed in the north-western United States, Nirvana's album 'Nevermind', fuelled by the success of lead single 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', would propel the genre to the forefront
      of global culture. A bit of a slow burner, 'Nevermind' released in September 1991, but it did not top the US Billboard 200 until February 1992, when it dethroned Michael Jackson's 'Dangerous'. 
			Nirvana's success would ultimately become Grunge's success, bringing other groups into the mainstream with them, such as Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. Many grunge artists were unhappy 
			with the popularity of the genre, in particular Nirvana's lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain. 'In Utero', the follow up to 'Nevermind', had a more unconventional sound, but nonetheless debuted on
			the Billboard 200 at number 1. Cobain's tragic death by suicide in April 1994 is often cited as the end of grunge in the mainstream.
      <br>
      While grunge bands ruled the early part of the 1990s, other bands would also have their break into the mainstream in the early part of the decade. Red Hot Chili Peppers would have major success with 
			their album 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' (1991), before releasing their best-selling album 'Californication' in 1999. The band had largely been ignored during the 1980s due to their unrefined, raw sound, but
			their new direction would have much greater appeal to the masses. Radiohead released 'Pablo Honey' in 1993, featuring the band's biggest single 'Creep'. They would go on to become one of the most
			critically acclaimed bands of all time, mostly due to their musical experimentation. 1997's 'OK Computer' is often cited as their magnum opus. Pop punk band Green Day would have their commercial
			breakthrough with 1994's 'Dookie', offering a more mainstream take on the punk rock of the 1970s.

			Over in Britain the 'Britpop' movement would take hold during the mid 1990s. Largely a reaction to the darker themes of grunge, early bands such as Blur and Suede would write more upbeat music with an
			emphasis on British identity and culture. 1994 would see Blur release 'Parklife', becoming one of the defining albums of the movement. Also in 1994 Oasis released their debut album 'Definitely Maybe',
			which became the fastest selling debut album in UK history, an accolade it held until 2006. These two bands would become the defining groups of the Britpop movement (Despite sharing little similarities
			sonically), culminating in the 1995 chart war between Blur's 'Country House' and Oasis' 'Roll With It', in which 'Country House' would claim the number 1 spot on the British singles chart, with 'Roll
			With It' occupying second. Oasis however would surpass Blur and take the movement worldwide following the release of '(What's the Story) Morning Glory?' in October, featuring their biggest single, and
			indeed one of the biggest songs ever, 'Wonderwall'. The movement fizzled out by the end of the 1990s, as Blur moved into alternative rock with their self titled album in 1997, and Oasis' 'Be Here Now'
			(1997) not having the impact of its predecessor.

	<h2 class="Ben">2000s</h2>
	<p class="Ben">
		The 2000s would see a range of bands from the 1990s continue their popularity. Green Day's 2004 album 'American Idiot' would be much more political than their previous material, became their second best
		selling album, only beaten by 'Dookie' from 1994. Red Hot Chili Peppers would continue their upwards trajectory, following up 'Californitcation' with 'By The Way' in 2002 and the double album
		'Stadium Arcadium' in 2006, the group would cement their reputation as one of the best selling bands of all time. Radiohead would release 'Kid A' in 2000, an album bearing a heavy influence from
		electronica. This continued the experimentation that began with 'OK Computer', and the two are often listed as two of the band's best records. Following 'Amnesiac' (2001) and 'Hail to the Thief'
		(2003) failing to meet expectations, 2008s 'In Rainbows' would recieve universal acclaim. Indie rock act The Strokes would release their debut 'Is This It' in 2001, often credited with saving the
		rock genre as a whole. It was praised for its effortless blend of classic rock with modern guitar-rock. The unique sound of lead singer Julian Casablanca's vocals is a particular highlight.

		Over in the UK a blossoming indie rock was growing. The legacy of Britpop was fading, as Blur would split in 2003 and Oasis in 2009. Coldplay's debut album 'Parachutes' dropped in 2000, offering a 
		softer take on the indie rock genre than many of their contemporaries. The album debuted at number 1 on the UK charts, spawning the iconic song 'Yellow'. Coldplay would go on to develop this sound in 
		2002 with 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head', and again in 2005 with 'X&Y', before transitioning away from traditional indie rock with later albums. Bands such as Kasabian and The Libertines would bring a 
		much higher energy to the UK indie scene, their music broadly inspired by the lives of youths in the UK at the time. Arctic Monkey's would adopt a similar approach in their 2006 debut 'Whatever People 
		Say I Am, That's What I'm Not'. which dethroned Oasis' 'Definitely Maybe' as the fastest selling debut album in UK history. They would release its successor, 'Favourite Worst Nightmare', in 2007, which
		largely developed this sound, before 2009's 'Humbug' would see them depart from their early indie sound. All 3 albums would debut at number 1 in the UK.

		Largely, however, the 2000s is cited as the end of traditional rock in the mainstream. Nu Metal acts such as Linkin Park would combine metal and rap music, which would largely take the place of rock
		in the charts during the early part of the decade. Many artists embraced innovations such as Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) and MIDI controllers which allowed for the creation of professional
		sounding music without traditional instrumental skills.

	<h2 class="Ben">2010s</h2>
		<p class="Ben">
			The 2010s would unfortunately be a continuation of the trends that had started in the 2000s. Pop rock act Imagine Dragons would be one of the more popular groups to emerge in the decade. The group
			would make heavy use of synthesisers in their music, leading to many rock purists discarding them as merely a pop group. Nonetheless, despite not recieving high praise critically, they would
			be a huge commercial success, becoming the first rock group to have four songs exceeding 1 billion streams on music streaming service 'Spotify'. Arctic Monkeys, who had been successful in
			the UK, would have their first global success with 'AM'. With the popularity of hip-hop in the mainstream, 'AM' would feature a groovier sound than the band's earlier work. The album debuted
			at number 1 on the UK charts, not unusual for the band's work, but a peak of number 6 on the US Billboard 200 marked the bands first major brekathrough in the United States. The single 'Do I Wanna
			Know?' became their first Billboard Hot 100 hit, reaching number 73. 

			As far as rock in the mainstream was concerned, there were not many innovations or major movements during this time. Most of the rock to acheive any sort of success was watered-down, 
			pop-esque records such as those from Twenty One Pilots and the aforementioned Imagine Dragons, or releases from already established rock acts. The Black Keys are often cited as one of the
			few acts to emerge in the early part of the 2010s that would be both commercially successful and faithful to the traditional blues-infused sound of old school rock and roll. Their sixth
			album, 'Brothers', released in 2010, would peak at number 3 on the Billboard 200, with follow up 'El Camino' peaking at number 2. 

			With rock largely disappearing from the general public's conscience, the indie scene would continue to grow and develop. A vibrant post-punk scene would emerge in the UK and Ireland. Most notable
			in this movement was Fontaines D.C., whose debut album 'Dogrel' would release in 2019. It would perform reasonably well for a debut album, peaking the Irish and UK charts at 4th and 9th
			respectively, but it would not be until the next decade where they would truly become a mainstream force in both Ireland and the UK.

	<h2 class="Ben">2020s</h2>
	<p class="Ben">
		Over the course of the current decade, rock music has experienced an unprescedented revival in the mainstream. Many commentators attribute this to the COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2020, which saw
		swathes of people taking up instruments. In addition, social media platforms such as TikTok would revitalise older songs, perhaps most famously Fleetwood Mac's 1977 hit 'Dreams', which currently has
		over 2.4 billion streams on Spotify. Several pop artists would begin to release rock-influenced music, such as Olivia Rodrigo and her 2021 hit 'Good 4 U', which recieved widespread praise for its
		instrumentation which was heaviy influenced by the pop punk scene of the 90s and 00s. 

		Fontaines D.C. would continue their upward trajectory, releasing 'A Hero's Death' (2020), 'Skinty Fia' (2022) and 'Romance' (2024). The release of 'Romance' in 2024 would give the band their largest
		spike in popularity, with songs such as 'Starburster' (peaked at #17 in Ireland and #57 in the UK) and 'Favourite' (#19 in Ireland, #65 in the UK) giving the band two of their biggest hits. 
		Another group on a steady upward trajectory is Wunderhorse. They would debut with the album 'Cub' in 2022, before following it up with 'Midas' in 2024. They have been widely praised for their
		energetic live performances and their sound, which takes heavy influences from 90s grunge. 

		So far, the decade has also been defined by the reunification and re-emergence of bands. The most notable of which happened this very year (2025), as Oasis would reunite for their first gigs since 2009. The frenzy
		around the reunion showed us all that there is still a desire burning in the hearts of the youth today for pure rock and roll music. For the intiial 17 shows announced across the UK and Ireland, 14
		million people applied for 1.4 million tickets. The tour prompted many of Oasis' classics to re-enter the charts in the UK and Ireland, with 1994's 'Live Forever' reaching a new peak of #3 in Ireland 
		and #8 in the UK. While never split up, The Rolling Stones would release their first album since 2005 with 2023's 'Hackney Diamonds'. The Strokes would release 'The New Abnormal' in 2020, their first
		album since 2013. The single 'The Adults Are Talking' is currently their third most streamed song on Spotify. A renewed interest in live music has seen bands such as AC/DC embark on sellout tours of
		arenas and stadiums across the world. While the decade is not over yet, it is clear to us all that the rock genre is far from dead in the mainstream.
