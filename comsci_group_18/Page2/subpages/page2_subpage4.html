      <h2 class="Ben">Led Zeppelin</h2>
      <p class="Ben">
        Led Zeppelin have always stood out to me due to the variety in their music. Their fundamental sound is that of a classic hard rock band, evident in songs such as 'Heartbreaker'. However, their
        experimentation with progressive rock gave birth to classics such as 'Stairway To Heaven' and 'Ten Years Gone', which take listeners on a musical journey through many different soundscapes.
        Other songs such as 'Going to California' show the bands prowess as an acoustic unit. The band provides a great example of what happens when each member of a band is a master of their craft.

      <h2 class="Ben">Oasis</h2>
      <p class="Ben">
        My favourite band of all time, the beauty of Oasis lies in the simplicity of the music. Noel Gallagher's songwriting focused more on the melodic aspects of the music rather than showcasing technical
        prowess. Meanwhile, lyrics focused on themes of everyday life, making them relatable to millions across the globe. These simplistic foundations would be combined with Liam Gallagher's iconic
        vocals and cranked-up amplifiers to create the band's iconic wall of sound. The band's biggest hits, such as 'Wonderwall', 'Don't Look Back In Anger' and 'Live Forever' posessed an anthemic quality
        that very few songs posessed following the death of grunge. While lacking the innovative streak that many of rock music's defining acts posessed, Oasis showed us all that simplicity is what resonates
        most with people
