      <h2 class="Ben">Led Zeppelin</h2>
      <img src="../images/ledzeppelin.jpg" alt="Led Zeppelin" class="Ben" width="100%" height="100%">
      <p class="Ben">
        Led Zeppelin have always stood out to me due to the variety in their music. Their fundamental sound is that of a classic hard rock band, evident in songs such as 'Heartbreaker'. However, their
        experimentation with progressive rock gave birth to classics such as 'Stairway To Heaven' and 'Ten Years Gone', which take listeners on a musical journey through many different soundscapes.
        Other songs such as 'Going to California' show the bands prowess as an acoustic unit. The band provides a great example of what happens when each member of a band is a master of their craft.

      <h2 class="Ben">Oasis</h2>
        <img src="../images/oasis.jpg" alt="Oasis" class="Ben" width="100%" height="100%">
          <p class="Ben">
            My favourite band of all time, the beauty of Oasis lies in the simplicity of the music. Noel Gallagher's songwriting focused more on the melodic aspects of the music rather than showcasing technical
            prowess. Meanwhile, lyrics focused on themes of everyday life, making them relatable to millions across the globe. These simplistic foundations would be combined with Liam Gallagher's iconic
            vocals and cranked-up amplifiers to create the band's iconic wall of sound. The band's biggest hits, such as 'Wonderwall', 'Don't Look Back In Anger' and 'Live Forever' posessed an anthemic quality
            that very few songs posessed following the death of grunge. While lacking the innovative streak that many of rock music's defining acts posessed, Oasis showed us all that simplicity is what resonates
            most with people

       <img src="../images/therollingstones.jpg" alt="The Rolling Stones" class="Ben" width="100%" height="100%">
      <p class="Ben">
      It was 1969 when The Rolling Stones were first introduced as 'the greatest rock and roll band in the world', a well-earned title for a band that has managed to last over 60 years. The Stones were true
      innovators when they burst onto the scene in the mid 60s, bringing a raw, gritty, blues-oriented sound to rock music. Equally as important to their impact would be the rebellious image they cultivated,
      as they became the quintissential 'bad boys' of rock. All of this was backed by the prolific songwriting partnership of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, yielding some of the most iconic songs of all
      time.

      <p class="Ben">
        If you're looking for something more modern, Wunderhorse have been on a steady upward trajectory since they released their debut album 'Cub' in 2022. They have brought a much more authentic sound to the
        indie rock genre. They have taken inspiration from genres such as grunge and Americana, leading to energetic anthems such as 'Leader Of The Pack', as well as more sombre offerings such as
        'Aeroplane' off of 2024's 'Midas'. The band have also recieved praise for their energetic live performances, which have contributed to their rise from underground indie band to being on the verge of
        breaking into the mainstream. They are certainly one to watch.

      <img src="../images/pinkfloyd.jpg" alt="Pink Floyd" class="Ben" width="100%" height="100%">
      <p class="Ben">
      There aren't many bands whose music can take a listener out of their current setting and transport them to a different place, yet Pink Floyd have managed to do this time after time with albums such as
      1973's 'The Dark Side Of The Moon' and 1979's 'The Wall'. They were among the first bands to utilise the studio itself as an instrument, utilising non-musical sounds, effects and synthesisers to add
      depth to their compositions. Personally, David Gilmour's guitar playing has always been the standout component of the band's greatest hits. Gilmour substituted flashy, technical soloing for a more
      melodic, understated approach. This gives his solos a level of emotional depth that cannot be matched.
